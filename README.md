## FreeCodeCamp Front End Project - Build a Random Quote Machine

## User Stories

- [ ] I can click a button to show a new random quote.
- [ ] I can also click a button that allows to tweet out a quote.

## Thoughts

I remember it was a hard case for me because right from the start I saw this example they showed in project description, and it was so good! I simply couldn't think of anything better! Anyway, after several days (or was it 2 weeks?) of hard thought I came upon this idea of colored circles that expand to fill the entire screen whenever you generate the next quote. Yes, the design is still quite generic, but at least I managed to add personal touch.
